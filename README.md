Benchmarks: Gob vs. Protocol Buffers
This benchmark compares the performance of Go's native gob encoding with Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for serializing and deserializing large slices of Transaction objects.

Results
Tests were run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G7 CPU @ 1.20GHz.

Lower values are better.

## Analysis üßê
The results clearly demonstrate that Protocol Buffers significantly outperforms Gob in all metrics, with the performance gap widening as the data size increases.

Speed (ns/op) üöÄ

Encoding: Protobuf is ~4-6 times faster than Gob.

Decoding: Protobuf is ~2-4 times faster than Gob.

Reason: Protobuf uses highly optimized, pre-generated code for serialization, whereas Gob relies on Go's runtime reflection, which introduces significant overhead.

Memory Usage & Allocations (B/op, allocs/op) üìâ

Protobuf uses approximately 5 times less memory and makes 3 times fewer memory allocations during decoding.

Reason: The Protobuf binary format is more compact. It uses numeric field tags instead of full field names, resulting in a smaller data footprint. Fewer allocations reduce pressure on the garbage collector (GC), leading to better overall application performance.

## Conclusion ‚úÖ
For a high-performance, distributed system like a blockchain, Protocol Buffers is the superior choice. While gob offers simplicity for Go-only projects, Protobuf provides critical advantages in speed, data size, and memory efficiency, making it the standard for performance-sensitive network applications.
