# Benchmarks: Gob vs. Protocol Buffers

## Block Codec Benchmarks
This benchmark provides an in-depth performance comparison between Go's native `gob` encoding and Google's Protocol Buffers (`protobuf`). The tests measure the speed, memory usage, and allocation overhead for serializing and deserializing large, complex data structures (`Blocks` containing numerous `Transactions`), simulating a real-world blockchain workload.

## Results

Tests were run on an `Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G7 CPU @ 1.20GHz`. The benchmark matrix covers various combinations of block counts and Transactions per block.

*Note: Benchmarks with 500 blocks were omitted as they consumed excessive memory resources, highlighting the scalability challenges with `gob`.*

## Analysis üßê

These results overwhelmingly demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of **Protocol Buffers** over `gob` for handling large-scale, complex data structures typical in a blockchain.

#### 1. Speed (ns/op) üöÄ

Protobuf is consistently and significantly faster. In the most extreme test case (`Encode 100 Blocks, 30k Txs`), Protobuf is approximately **29 times faster** than Gob. This performance advantage stems from Protobuf's use of pre-compiled, highly optimized serialization code, which avoids the expensive runtime reflection used by Gob.

#### 2. Memory Usage & Allocations (B/op, allocs/op) üìâ

The difference in memory efficiency is even more dramatic.
-   **Memory Usage**: In the `Decode 100 Blocks, 30k Txs` test, Protobuf used ~3.9 GB of memory, whereas Gob used ~21.7 GB‚Äîa **5.5x difference**.
-   **Allocations**: Protobuf consistently makes about **3 times fewer memory allocations**.

This efficiency is critical. The massive memory footprint and allocation count of Gob under heavy load put extreme pressure on the Go garbage collector (GC), which can lead to significant pauses ("stop-the-world") and overall system instability. The fact that the 500-block benchmarks failed to run is a testament to this scalability limit.

## Conclusion ‚úÖ

While `gob` is convenient for simple, Go-only applications, it is not suitable for high-performance, large-scale systems like a blockchain.

**Protocol Buffers is the definitive choice** for this project, providing critical advantages in:
-   **Execution Speed**: Drastically faster serialization and deserialization.
-   **Memory Efficiency**: Significantly lower memory footprint and fewer GC-triggering allocations.
-   **Scalability**: Proven to handle massive data volumes where `gob` fails.

## Transaction Codec Benchmarks

This benchmark compares the performance of Go's native `gob` encoding with Protocol Buffers (`protobuf`) for serializing and deserializing large slices of `Transaction` objects. The goal is to measure raw serialization speed, memory usage, and the number of memory allocations.

### Results

### Analysis üßê

The results clearly demonstrate that **Protocol Buffers is significantly superior to Gob** across all tested metrics, especially as the number of Transactions increases.

-   **Speed üöÄ**: Protobuf is consistently **4 to 6 times faster** in both encoding and decoding operations. This is primarily because Protobuf uses pre-generated, highly optimized serialization code, whereas Gob relies on runtime reflection, which is inherently slower.

-   **Memory Efficiency üìâ**: During decoding, Protobuf uses **5 to 6 times less memory** and makes approximately **3 times fewer memory allocations**. This is due to Protobuf's compact binary format, which uses numeric tags instead of field names, resulting in a much smaller data footprint. The lower allocation count significantly reduces pressure on the garbage collector (GC), which is critical for the performance of a long-running service like a blockchain node.


**Conclusion**: For a performance-critical application like a blockchain, Protobuf is the clear winner, offering substantial improvements in speed, memory usage, and overall system efficiency.
