## Transaction Codec Benchmarks

This benchmark compares the performance of Go's native `gob` encoding with Protocol Buffers (`protobuf`) for serializing and deserializing large slices of `Transaction` objects. The goal is to measure raw serialization speed, memory usage, and the number of memory allocations.

### Results

Tests were run on an `Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G7 CPU @ 1.20GHz`.

### Analysis üßê

The results clearly demonstrate that **Protocol Buffers is significantly superior to Gob** across all tested metrics, especially as the number of Transactions increases.

-   **Speed üöÄ**: Protobuf is consistently **4 to 6 times faster** in both encoding and decoding operations. This is primarily because Protobuf uses pre-generated, highly optimized serialization code, whereas Gob relies on runtime reflection, which is inherently slower.

-   **Memory Efficiency üìâ**: During decoding, Protobuf uses **5 to 6 times less memory** and makes approximately **3 times fewer memory allocations**. This is due to Protobuf's compact binary format, which uses numeric tags instead of field names, resulting in a much smaller data footprint. The lower allocation count significantly reduces pressure on the garbage collector (GC), which is critical for the performance of a long-running service like a blockchain node.


**Conclusion**: For a performance-critical application like a blockchain, Protobuf is the clear winner, offering substantial improvements in speed, memory usage, and overall system efficiency.
